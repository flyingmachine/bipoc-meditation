        <h2>What We Do Together</h2>
        <p>
          A co-creative meditation space designed to foster a sense of belonging and
          nurture meaningful connections for people who identify as Black,
          Indigenous, and People of Color.
        </p>
        <p>
          We gather as kindred souls, each bringing unique experiences and
          perspectives, to sit, breathe, meditate, and engage in self-reflection and
          open-hearted group experiences. Our meditation group values each voice and
          embraces the richness of our collective wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, be part of a circle where your presence and unique journey are
          celebrated. We can't wait to welcome you and meditate together.

        </p>

        <h2>What a Meeting Looks Like</h2>

        <p>
          Our meeting structure embodies the values we hold in how we want to
          show up for ourselves and each other.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>
            <span>6:30-6:45</span>
            arrive at space, set up, and settle
          </dt>
          <dd>
            We honor our capacity and practice radically sharing responsibilities
            amongst the entire group. We all set up chairs and cushions and otherwise
            ready the space for meditation.
          </dd>


          <dt>
            <span>6:45</span>
            ring bell, arrive on cushions or chairs
          </dt>
          <dd>
            We counter urgency and create space for arriving, connecting, and
            settling.
          </dd>


          <dt>
            <span>6:45-7:10</span>
            settle, meditate
          </dt>
          <dd>
            We embrace an ethic of consent and choice, and we strive to create
            an environment that supports everyone's agency and dignity. You are
            encouraged to take care of your bodily needs and to make yourself
            comfortable without asking. Meditation is peer-led and instructions
            are offered with a spirit of invitation: you are invited to try them,
            and supported in your choice to instead engage in your own personal
            practice.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <span>7:10-7:15</span>
            reading
          </dt>
          <dd>
            We cultivate our connections to each other and to wisdom traditions
            around the world. The practice leader will share an excerpt, poem,
            or other reading from a teacher or culture-shaper to inspire and center
            our time together.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <span>7:15-7:45</span>
            individual shares and group discussion
          </dt>
          <dd>
            We practice compassionate listening and mindful sharing. Each person
            has a chance to share what's on their heart or to pass. Then we have
            a general group discussion. We avoid giving advice but instead seek to
            explore the reading further and understand each other more deeply.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <span>7:45-7:50</span> closing
          </dt>
          <dd>
            We share a moment of grounding to connect into the resources outside
            of the space and close the circle with intention.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <span>7:50-8:00</span>
            reset the space
          </dt>
          <dd>
            We take care of our shared space, putting things away and tidying up.
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <span>8:00</span>
            close doors
          </dt>
          <dd>
            We honor each other's energy and time by maintaining a clear ending
            time, and clearly communicating if/when that time might be extended.
          </dd>
