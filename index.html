        <h2>What We Do Together</h2>
        <p>
          A co-creative meditation space designed to foster a sense of belonging and
          nurture meaningful connections for people who identify as Black,
          Indigenous, and People of Color.
        </p>
        <p>
          We gather as kindred souls, each bringing unique experiences and
          perspectives, to sit, breathe, meditate, and engage in self-reflection and
          open-hearted group experiences. Our meditation group values each voice and
          embraces the richness of our collective wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come, be part of a circle where your presence and unique journey are
          celebrated. We can't wait to welcome you and meditate together.
        </p>
